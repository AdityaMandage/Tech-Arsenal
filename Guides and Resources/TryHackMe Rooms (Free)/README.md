# TryHackMe Free Rooms

## Overview

This interactive web application is designed to help beginners in cybersecurity easily track their progress through TryHackMe's free rooms. 

Inspired by [rng70/TryHackMe-Roadmap](https://github.com/rng70/TryHackMe-Roadmap), which provides a comprehensive list of free TryHackMe rooms sorted by domains, this project enhances the usability of the data by offering an interactive checklist. Users can mark rooms as completed, track their progress, and even flag rooms as invalid if they are no longer free or unavailable.

## Features

- **Interactive Checklist**: View and interact with a checklist of TryHackMe free rooms.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor overall progress and see how many rooms have been completed.
- **Invalid Room Handling**: Mark rooms as invalid and remove them from progress calculations.

## Need Help !

Go through the html file and json file. As you may have noticed the room's data that I have added is hardcoded into the code itself, what I want is that it should use it from `tryhackmeRooms.json`. Help me solve this problem. How to use data directly from .json file instead of adding data in code.
